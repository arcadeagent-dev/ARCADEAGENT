# TASKAGENT

Welcome to **TASKAGENT** – an advanced Artificial Intelligence designed to play your favorite games for you! Built with Python, TASKAGENT.AI is capable of analyzing, strategizing, and mastering a wide variety of games, from simple puzzles to complex simulations.

---

## Features

- **Game Mastery**: TASKAGENT can learn and play games autonomously, mastering game mechanics, and optimizing strategies.
- **Adaptive Learning**: With every move, TASKAGENT refines its strategies, ensuring better performance with time.
- **Multi-Game Support**: Whether it’s board games, video games, or simulation games, TASKAGENT can handle various types.
- **Customizable Profiles**: Tailor the AI to suit specific game styles, difficulty levels, or preferences.

## Usage

Once installed, running TASKAGENT in any game is simple. Use the provided command line interface (CLI) or integrate it with your favorite games.

To run TASKAGENT:

```bash
python taskagent.py --game <game_name> --difficulty <level>
```

Where:
- `<game_name>` is the name of the game you want TASKAGENT to play.
- `<level>` specifies the difficulty setting (e.g., `easy`, `medium`, `hard`).

For example:
```bash
python main.py --game "Chess" --difficulty "hard"
```

## Technical Details
TASKAGENT.AI is built using Python and leverages several powerful libraries for AI and game simulation:

TensorFlow/PyTorch: For machine learning and neural network-based decision-making.
OpenCV: Used for visual recognition and pixel-based analysis in games with graphical interfaces.
Pygame: To create and simulate simple games, allowing TASKAGENT.AI to test its strategies directly.
NumPy/Pandas: For data manipulation and handling game state during simulations.
The AI uses reinforcement learning techniques to adapt its strategies over time. The more it plays, the better it becomes!

## FAQ

Q: Can I train TASKAGENT on my own games?
A: Yes! TASKAGENT is highly adaptable. You can train it on your own game by providing it with game logic and interaction functions.

Q: How does TASKAGENT learn?
A: TASKAGENT uses reinforcement learning to continually improve its gameplay. It evaluates its actions based on a reward system to determine the best moves over time.

Q: Can I play multiplayer games with TASKAGENT?
A: Currently, TASKAGENT is designed to play solo games. However, multiplayer functionality is in the works!
